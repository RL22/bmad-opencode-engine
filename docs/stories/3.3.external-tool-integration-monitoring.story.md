## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Stories 3.1 and 3.2 completion, the parallel workflow execution engine and advanced error handling framework provide a solid foundation for external tool integration. The existing parallel execution capabilities can be extended to handle external tools, while the comprehensive error handling system can be enhanced to manage external service failures.

### Architecture Context
[Source: packages/workflow-engine/main.go]

**Current Workflow Engine Structure:**
- WorkflowEngine struct with parallel execution capabilities (from Story 3.1)
- Advanced error handling framework with classification and recovery (from Story 3.2)
- Template-based document creation and checklist validation systems
- Support for interactive and YOLO execution modes

**Integration Points:**
- WorkflowEngine.executeStep() method: Extend to support external tool step types
- ParallelExecutor: Enhance for concurrent external tool execution
- Error handling framework: Add external tool-specific error types and recovery
- Progress monitoring: Integrate external tool progress with existing tracking

**External Tool Categories:**
- HTTP/REST API services (webhooks, microservices, SaaS platforms)
- Command-line tools and utilities (git, docker, kubectl, terraform)
- Database connections and queries (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- File processing services (document converters, image processors)
- CI/CD pipeline integrations (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI)
- Monitoring and observability tools (Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus)

**Data Models:**
- ExternalTool: Contains name, version, endpoint, auth, timeout, retry config
- ToolExecution: Contains status, progress, output, errors, metrics
- ToolRegistry: Contains registered tools, capabilities, metadata
- MonitoringData: Contains real-time status, progress, performance metrics

**Security Requirements:**
- Credential encryption and secure storage using Go crypto packages
- TLS/SSL for all external communications
- API key, OAuth 2.0, and certificate-based authentication support
- Role-based access control for tool permissions
- Audit logging for all external tool interactions

**Technical Constraints:**
- Go HTTP client with timeout and retry capabilities
- JSON serialization for external API communication
- Concurrent-safe external tool execution with mutex protection
- CLI-friendly progress output with real-time updates
- Configuration management via YAML and environment variables

### Project Structure Notes
All external tool integration enhancements will be contained within the existing `packages/workflow-engine/` directory to maintain the current monorepo structure. New external tool configurations will be added to workflow YAML files with clear documentation and examples. The integration will maintain backward compatibility while providing powerful new capabilities for complex workflows.
