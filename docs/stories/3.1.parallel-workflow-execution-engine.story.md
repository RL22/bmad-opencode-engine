# Story 3.1: Parallel Workflow Step Execution Engine

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story

**As a** developer using BMAD OpenCode Engine,
**I want** to execute independent workflow steps in parallel,
**so that** I can reduce overall workflow execution time while maintaining data integrity and proper dependency management.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Parallel Execution Framework**: The WorkflowEngine shall analyze workflow steps and identify those that can be executed in parallel based on dependencies
2. **Dependency Management**: The system shall create and maintain a dependency graph to ensure proper execution order and prevent race conditions
3. **Concurrent Processing**: The system shall execute independent template creation and checklist validation operations concurrently using Go goroutines
4. **Data Integrity**: The system shall ensure atomic file operations and prevent conflicts when multiple steps access the same resources
5. **Progress Monitoring**: The system shall provide real-time progress tracking for all parallel tasks with individual step status indicators
6. **Error Isolation**: The system shall isolate errors in parallel tasks, allowing successful tasks to complete while handling failures appropriately
7. **Synchronization Points**: The system shall implement synchronization barriers where dependent steps must wait for prerequisites to complete
8. **Resource Management**: The system shall manage system resources (file handles, memory, CPU) to prevent resource exhaustion during parallel execution
9. **Backward Compatibility**: The system shall maintain full compatibility with existing Epic 1 & Epic 2 sequential workflow functionality
10. **Configuration Control**: The system shall allow users to configure parallel execution settings including max concurrency and timeout values

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Epic 2 completion, the workflow engine successfully handles sequential multi-step workflows with template-driven document creation and checklist validation. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for extending to parallel execution.

### Architecture Context
[Source: packages/workflow-engine/main.go]

**Current WorkflowEngine Structure:**
- WorkflowEngine struct with reader, processor, and checklistProcessor components
- Sequential step execution in main workflow loop
- Template-based document creation with DocumentProcessor
- Checklist validation with ChecklistProcessor
- Support for both interactive and YOLO execution modes

**Data Models:**
- WorkflowStep: Contains agent, task, prompt, template, checklist, mode, and variables
- Workflow: Contains name, description, steps, and variables
- Template/Checklist structures for document processing

**Key Components to Extend:**
- WorkflowEngine.executeStep() method for parallel dispatch
- DocumentProcessor for thread-safe template processing  
- ChecklistProcessor for concurrent checklist validation
- File I/O operations throughout the system

**Compatibility Requirements:**
- Maintain existing workflow YAML format and structure
- Preserve all Epic 1 & Epic 2 functionality
- Support both interactive and YOLO modes in parallel execution
- Keep existing CLI interface and output formatting

**Technical Constraints:**
- Go modules for dependency management
- YAML parsing with gopkg.in/yaml.v3
- File system operations with proper error handling
- CLI-friendly output with progress indicators and emojis

### File Locations
- Main workflow engine: `packages/workflow-engine/main.go`
- New parallel execution components to be added to same package
- Test files to be created in `packages/workflow-engine/` directory
- Example parallel workflows in `workflows/` directory

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for all new parallel execution components
- Integration tests with existing Epic 1 & 2 workflows
- Concurrent execution tests with race condition detection
- Performance benchmarks comparing sequential vs parallel execution
- Error scenario testing with resource cleanup validation

**Test File Locations:**
- `packages/workflow-engine/parallel_test.go`
- `packages/workflow-engine/dependency_test.go`
- `packages/workflow-engine/integration_test.go`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Go's built-in testing package
- Race condition detection with `go test -race`
- Benchmarking with testing.B for performance validation
- Table-driven tests for comprehensive scenario coverage

**Performance Testing:**
- Measure execution time improvements for parallel-eligible workflows
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, file handles)
- Test scalability with varying numbers of parallel steps
- Validate timeout handling and cancellation mechanisms

### Project Structure Notes
All parallel execution enhancements will be contained within the existing `packages/workflow-engine/` directory to maintain the current monorepo structure. New configuration options will be added to workflow YAML files while preserving backward compatibility.
