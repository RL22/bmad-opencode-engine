# Story 3.2: Advanced Error Handling & Recovery Framework

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** developer using BMAD OpenCode Engine,
**I want** comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation, automatic retry mechanisms, and state preservation,
**so that** I can recover from failures without losing work and get clear guidance for resolving issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Graceful Degradation**: The system shall continue processing non-dependent workflow steps when individual components fail
2. **Automatic Retry Mechanisms**: The system shall implement intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
3. **State Preservation**: The system shall save workflow progress and state before critical operations to enable recovery
4. **User-Friendly Error Messages**: The system shall provide clear, actionable error messages with specific guidance for resolution
5. **Error Classification**: The system shall categorize errors by type (template, filesystem, network, agent, workflow, user input) and severity
6. **Recovery Actions**: The system shall offer context-appropriate recovery options including resume, retry, skip, or abort operations
7. **Comprehensive Logging**: The system shall maintain detailed error logs with context, stack traces, and debugging information
8. **Integration Compatibility**: The system shall maintain full compatibility with Epic 1 & 2 functionality while adding error handling
9. **Parallel Execution Support**: The system shall handle errors in parallel workflow execution with proper isolation and aggregation
10. **Timeout Management**: The system shall implement configurable timeouts with graceful cancellation for long-running operations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Story 3.1 completion, the parallel workflow execution engine provides the foundation for sophisticated error handling across concurrent operations. The existing sequential error handling from Epic 1 & 2 needs extension to support parallel execution scenarios while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Architecture Context
[Source: packages/workflow-engine/main.go]

**Current Error Handling Architecture:**
- Basic error propagation in WorkflowEngine.executeStep() method
- Simple error logging in DocumentProcessor and ChecklistProcessor
- File operation error handling in template and checklist processing
- No retry mechanisms or state preservation currently implemented

**Key Components to Enhance:**
- WorkflowEngine struct: Add error handling configuration and state management
- DocumentProcessor: Implement graceful degradation for template processing
- ChecklistProcessor: Add retry logic for validation operations
- ParallelExecutor: Integrate error isolation and aggregation (from Story 3.1)

**Error Context Integration:**
- Template processing errors: Invalid YAML, missing variables, circular references
- File system errors: Permission denied, disk space, concurrent access conflicts
- Network errors: API timeouts, rate limiting, connection failures (for future integrations)
- Agent errors: Model unavailability, token limits, processing failures
- Workflow errors: Step dependencies, state corruption, execution timeouts
- User input errors: Invalid formats, cancellation requests, missing required data

**State Management Requirements:**
- Checkpoint workflow state before each step execution
- Serialize complex objects (templates, checklists, variables) for recovery
- Maintain execution context across retry attempts
- Support partial workflow resumption from saved state

**Compatibility Requirements:**
- Maintain all existing Epic 1 & 2 functionality without regression
- Preserve current CLI interface and output formatting
- Support both interactive and YOLO modes with enhanced error handling
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing workflow YAML files

**Technical Constraints:**
- Go error interface and custom error types for classification
- JSON serialization for state preservation and logging
- Concurrent-safe error handling for parallel execution
- CLI-friendly error messages with color coding and progress indicators

### File Locations
- Main workflow engine: `packages/workflow-engine/main.go`
- New error handling components: `packages/workflow-engine/errors.go`
- State management: `packages/workflow-engine/state.go`
- Recovery system: `packages/workflow-engine/recovery.go`
- Test files: `packages/workflow-engine/error_test.go`, `packages/workflow-engine/recovery_test.go`

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for all error classification and handling components
- Integration tests with Epic 1 & 2 sequential workflows
- Integration tests with Epic 3.1 parallel execution scenarios
- Error injection testing for comprehensive failure scenario coverage
- Recovery testing with state corruption and partial failure scenarios

**Test File Locations:**
- `packages/workflow-engine/error_handling_test.go`
- `packages/workflow-engine/state_preservation_test.go`
- `packages/workflow-engine/retry_mechanism_test.go`
- `packages/workflow-engine/integration_error_test.go`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Go's built-in testing package with custom error injection utilities
- Table-driven tests for comprehensive error scenario coverage
- Mock interfaces for simulating network and file system failures
- Race condition testing for parallel execution error handling

**Error Scenario Testing:**
- Template parsing failures with malformed YAML
- File system permission errors and disk space issues
- Concurrent file access conflicts during parallel execution
- Network timeout simulation for future API integrations
- State corruption scenarios with recovery validation
- User cancellation during long-running operations

**Performance Testing:**
- Error handling overhead measurement in normal operation
- Recovery time benchmarks for various failure scenarios
- Memory usage validation during error state preservation
- Parallel execution error isolation performance impact

### Project Structure Notes
All error handling enhancements will be integrated into the existing `packages/workflow-engine/` directory structure. New error handling modules will be added as separate files while maintaining the current monorepo architecture. Configuration options for error handling will be added to workflow YAML files with sensible defaults to ensure backward compatibility.
